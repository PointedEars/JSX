This code may be used and modified within the limits described below

HOW TO USE:
I recommend to utilize the functions of this script in different
HTML documents when saving the entire file as top.js and appending the
following section within the <BODY></BODY> as follows:

<p><a href="#" class="button" onClick='window.close(); return false();'><script language="JavaScript1.2" src="close.js" type="text/javascript"></script><noscript>&nbsp;</noscript>[...]</a></p>

You should write the code including the <script></script> section without any (CR)LF
to avoid undesired spaces on display.


Description
____________

Dependent whether W3C-conform DHTML is available (at the creation of
this script this was only IE 5 and above, and NS 6 and above), it utilizes the cascading style-sheet
(CSS) named span.symbol defined in lcars.css to write the "top" character
defined by this CSS instead of writing &nbsp;.
