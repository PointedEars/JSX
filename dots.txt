HOW TO USE:
I recommend to utilize the functions of this script in different
HTML documents when saving the entire file as script.js and appending the
following section within the <BODY><DIV id="div_content"></DIV></BODY> tags
of that documents where DIV defines the text to be hidden until loading is completed:

<script language="JavaScript1.2" src="dots.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

dots.js requires undots.js (removes the status display and returns to normal display)
to be called at the end of the HTML document for the function make sense.


Description
------------

This script initializes a window interval in which the <span> object named "dots" is
modified. For the first second the script is running, one dot is displayed in "dots".
The next second a dot and a space is added to that display. When the amount of dots
reaches 3, the next second it will continue displaying with no dots and so on until
undots.js is included.
