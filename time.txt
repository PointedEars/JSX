HOW TO USE:
I recommend to utilize the functions of this script in different
HTML documents when saving the entire file as time.js and appending the
following section within the <HEAD></HEAD> tags of that documents:

<script src="time.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

The following items are provided by this script:

SystemTime class
__________________

Properties:  hours, minutes, seconds, sec100, dayCount
Methods:     decHours(...), decMinutes(...), decSeconds(...), decSec100(...),
             incHours(...), incMinutes(...), incSeconds(...), incSec100(...), toString()

Description:

The JSX:SystemTime class provides encapsulation for time data independent from the
JavaScript:Date class (which encapsulates date and time).

The properties except dayCount define the time value stored in a SystemTime instance.

The dayCount property is a Boolean value that defines whether the hours interval should
be restricted from 0 to 23 (dayCount == true) or counted upwards until the
upper Integer border (dayCount == false) is reached. Default is (dayCount == false).

Use the dec...(...) methods to decrease and the inc...(...) methods to increase (tick)
the value stored in the SystemTime in defined intervals
[dec...(...) useful for a countdown display and inc...(...) for a website clock counter].

Use the fromData(...) method to set all properties at once via the method call.

Use the fromString(...) method to set properties reading a string that contain their values.

Use the toString(...) method to return a string vice-versa that you can assign to the
innerHTML property or other String properties for the visualization of the stored data.

The fromString(...) and toString(...) methods are complementary
[ t.fromString(t.toString()) should change nothing ].
