This code may be used and modified within the limits described below

HOW TO USE:
I recommend to utilize the functions of this script in different
HTML documents when saving the entire file as script.js and appending the
following section within the <HEAD></HEAD> tags of that documents:

<script language="JavaScript1.1" src="cookies.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>

The following items are provided by this script:

CCookie class
--------------

Properties:	name, value, expires, domain, path, secure
Methods:	LoadData(sData), toString(), aboutMe(showMsg)

Description:

The CCookie class provides encapsulation for a cookie's properties.
Pass a cookie data string as retrieved from document.cookie (sData) to
the LoadData method to convert the cookie's data into object properties.
Use the toString() method to convert the data vice-versa and return a string
that you can assign to document.cookie.
The aboutMe(...) method either retrieves a string where all properties
are divided by a CR character (showMsg == false), and property name and
value are divided by an equal sign (=), or displays that string in a
common message box (showMsg == true).
aboutMe(true) also displays the version of the library containing the
CCookie class you are using. You can also retrieve the library version
without a message box when reading the CCookieVersion variable
as defined in the script file.
