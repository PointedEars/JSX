TERMS OF USE:
This code may be used and modified within the limits described below
for non-commercial purposes only and if the copyright above is also
mentioned.

HOW TO USE:
I recommend to utilize the functions of this script in different
HTML documents when saving the entire file as script.js and appending the
following section within the <BODY><DIV id="div_content"></DIV></BODY> tags
of that documents where DIV defines the text to be hidden until loading is completed:

<script language="JavaScript1.2" src="undots.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

undots.js requires dots.js (initializes the status display)
to be called before undots.js in the HTML document for the function make sense.


Description
------------

This script clears the window interval in which the <span> object named "dots" is
modified and displays the content within the <div> object named "div_content".
