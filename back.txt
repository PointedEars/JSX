This code may be used and modified within the limits described below

HOW TO USE:
I recommend to utilize the functions of this script in different
HTML documents when saving the entire file as back.js and appending the
following section within the <BODY></BODY> as follows:

<p><a href="backfile.htm" class="button" onClick='this.blur(); history.back();'>
<script language="JavaScript1.2" src="back.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<noscript>&nbsp;</noscript>[...]</a></p>

You should write the code including the <script></script> section without any (CR)LF
to avoid undesired spaces on display.


Description
------------

Dependent whether W3C-conform DHTML is available (at the creation of this script this was only IE 5 and above),
it utilizes the cascading style-sheet (CSS) named span.symbol defined in lcars.css to write the the "back" character
(kind of "<") defined by this CSS instead of writing &nbsp;.
